# Synister - the Source

First [release](https://github.com/the-synister/the-source/releases) is out! 

## What is Synister?

Synister is a synthesizer plugin for Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). It has been tested on the following DAWs: Logic, Ableton Live, and Maschine. 

### Features

The synister has 3 oscillators, 3 envelopes, 3 LFO's, 2 filters (which can be ladder, bandpass, highpass, or lowpass), 4 effects (delay, chorus, clipping, and low fidelity), and last but not least, a step sequencer with up to 8 steps!

The modulation has been made as easy as possible. Select the source, regulate the amount - done!

The oscillators and the filters element's can be modulated by different MiDi's CC and/or an LFO or Envelopes! 

For the LFO's and Envelopes, the modulation can be only made by the MIDI's CC! 

## How to use it?

You have to install the plugin and after that you can use it directly with any DAW!
